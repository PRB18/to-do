# RPG Task Manager

A fun and gamified to-do list application that turns task management into an RPG adventure! Manage your quests (tasks) with deadlines, earn XP, level up, and avoid losing HP by completing tasks on time.

## Features

- **Quest Management**: Add tasks with titles and deadlines as quests in your quest log.
- **RPG Elements**:
  - Player HP (Health Points): Starts at 100. Completing quests heals HP, missing deadlines causes damage.
  - XP and Leveling: Gain XP by completing quests to level up (level display included).
  - Economy System: Earn coins by completing tasks for future use.
- **Task Status Tracking**: Tasks can be pending, completed, or missed (with visual indicators).
- **Deadline Simulation**: "Check Deadlines" button simulates time passing, applying penalties for overdue tasks.
- **Simple UI**: Clean, inline-styled interface with buttons for adding and completing tasks.

## How to Use

1. **Open the App**: Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. **Add a Quest**: Enter a task name and deadline, then click "Add Task".
3. **Complete Quests**: Click the "Complete" button next to a pending task to mark it done, gain XP, and heal HP.
4. **Check Deadlines**: Click "Check Deadlines" to simulate time and see if any tasks are overdue (causes HP damage if missed).
5. **Monitor HP**: Keep an eye on your HP display. If it drops to 0, it's game over!
